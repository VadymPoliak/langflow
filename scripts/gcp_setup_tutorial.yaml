- title: Introduction
  content: |
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy Langflow on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google Cloud Shell.

    This tutorial assumes you have a GCP account and basic knowledge of Google Cloud Shell. If you're not familiar with Cloud Shell, you can review the [Cloud Shell documentation](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs).

- title: Set up your environment
  content: |
    Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

    - A GCP account with the necessary permissions to create resources
    - A project on GCP where you want to deploy Langflow

    <walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

    In the next step, you'll clone the Langflow repository and navigate to the `scripts` directory.

- title: Clone the repository and navigate to the scripts directory
  content: |
    Run the following commands to clone the Langflow repository and navigate to the `scripts` directory:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/genome21/langflow
    cd langflow/scripts
    ```

    In the next step, you'll configure the GCP environment and deploy Langflow.

- title: Configure the GCP environment and deploy Langflow
  content: |
    Run the `deploy_langflow_gcp.sh` script to configure the GCP environment and deploy Langflow:

    ```
    ./deploy_langflow_gcp.sh
    ```

    The script will:

    1. Check if the required resources (VPC, subnet, firewall rules, and Cloud Router) exist and create them if needed
    2. Create a startup script to install Python, Langflow, and Nginx
    3. Create a Compute Engine VM instance with the specified configuration and startup script
    4. Configure Nginx to serve Langflow on TCP port 8080

    In the next step, you'll learn how to connect to the Langflow VM.

- title: Connect to the Langflow VM
  content: |
    To connect to your new Langflow VM, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the [VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) page
    2. Click on the external IP for your VM
    3. Add port 8080 (assuming your VM external IP is 192.168.0.1):
    http://192.168.0.1:8080
    4. You will be greeted by the Langflow Dev environment

    Congratulations! You have successfully deployed Langflow on Google Cloud Platform.

- title: Cleanup
  content: |
    If you want to remove the resources created during this tutorial, you can use the following commands:

    ```
    gcloud compute instances delete langflow-dev --zone us-central1-a --quiet
    gcloud compute routers nats delete nat-gateway --router nat-client --region us-central1 --quiet
    gcloud compute routers delete nat-client --region us-central1 --quiet
    gcloud compute firewall-rules delete allow-tcp-8080 --quiet
    gcloud compute firewall-rules delete allow-iap --quiet
    gcloud compute networks subnets delete default --region us-central1 --quiet
    gcloud compute networks delete default --quiet
    ``
