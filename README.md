LangFlow is a no-code flow builder for LangChain, designed to provide a drag-and-drop UI, combining the capabilities of LangChain with reactFlow and a chat interface.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install LangFlow from pip:

`pip install langflow`

Next, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable using one of the following methods:

- Use the following command in your terminal: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key`.
- In a Python script or Jupyter notebook, use the following code: `import os; os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"`.

## üé® Creating Flows

Creating flows with LangFlow is easy, thanks to its intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Simply drag components from the sidebar onto the canvas, and connect them together to create your custom NLP pipeline. LangFlow provides a range of pre-built components to choose from, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.

## üíª Examples

LangFlow comes with a number of example flows to help you get started. These examples cover a range of use cases, from chatbots and question-answering systems to data augmentation and model comparison. You can use these examples as a starting point for your own custom flows, or modify them to suit your needs.

## üß∞ Components

LangFlow provides support for LangChain main components, including prompts, LLMs, document loaders, utils, chains, indexes, agents, and memory. For each module, we provide examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.

For more information on each component, please refer to the [Modules section of the LangChain documentation](https://langchain-docs.example.com/modules).
